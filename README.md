Semantic Text Similarity (STS) is a concept in natural language processing (NLP) that involves evaluating the degree to which two text segments are semantically similar to each other. This can be important for various applications such as information retrieval, text summarization, question answering, and more. Large Language Models (LLMs) like BERT, GPT-2, ROBERTA, and others play a significant role in assessing semantic text similarity.
